It’s unclear in the fog
But there’s someone inside
It’s familiar as if they feel me but
It’s different, different, different
Your waving hand
Not sure if you want me to come or go
What does it mean, tell me about it

If there’s two earths
It could be a different me too

When I take one step closer
The flower path grows thorns
Then you reach out to save me

Hey
When I meet you after time passes
I’ll know uh (you were my future)
I’ll know uh (I was your yesterday)

When I meet you after time passes
I’ll know uh (you protected me)
I’ll know uh (I desired you)

My I

The small wing on my wingbone
When will it grow bigger
When my own wind blows
Is that when I’ll be able to extend these wings

When I close my eyes, when I breathe
If I don’t deceive myself
I won’t be lost or sad

When I take one step closer
The flower path grows thorns
Then you reach out to save me

Hey
When I meet you after time passes
I’ll know uh (you were my future)
I’ll know uh (I was your yesterday)

When I meet you after time passes
I’ll know uh (you protected me)
I’ll know uh (I desired you)

My I
